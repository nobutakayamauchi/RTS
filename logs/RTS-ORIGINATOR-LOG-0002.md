# RTS ORIGINATOR LOG 0002 — Canonical Repository & Operating Declaration

Date (JST): 2026-01-20
Originator (real name): Nobutaka Yamauchi
GitHub account: nobutakayamauchi
Repository (canonical): https://github.com/nobutakayamauchi/RTS

## 1. Purpose of this log
This log records the decision to designate a canonical public repository for the RTS charter and logs, and to declare the basic operating stance of the RTS originator.

This entry exists to make explicit **where the RTS original text lives**, **how it is treated**, and **what authority the originator does and does not hold**.

## 2. Decision (Do / No-Do)
**Do:**  
- Use this GitHub repository as the canonical public reference for RTS.
- Record decisions, assumptions, and actions through append-only logs.

**No-Do:**  
- Do not treat RTS as an enforcement system.
- Do not grant the originator exclusive authority over approval, judgment, or conclusions.

## 3. Rationale
- GitHub provides immutable, timestamped commit history suitable for third-party verification.
- Public access enables global inspection and retrospective audit.
- Separation of a frozen charter and evolving logs prevents silent rule changes.

## 4. Freeze rule for the charter
- The RTS Charter contained in `README.md` is frozen as **Version 1.0**.
- The charter text will not be modified, deleted, or rewritten.
- Any interpretation, clarification, or operational note must be recorded via:
  - `/logs/` (primary)
  - supplementary documents (if required)
  - or GitHub Issues for discussion trails  
These do **not** constitute charter revision.

## 5. Governance & originator stance
I, **Nobutaka Yamauchi**, act as the originator of RTS and publisher of its initial canonical record.

- I do not monopolize approval, operation, or judgment.
- I accept that my own decisions are subject to scrutiny under the same logging rules.
- My responsibility is limited to:
  - maintaining public availability of the canonical repository,
  - logging my own actions and decisions transparently,
  - accepting counter-arguments, evidence, and criticism as part of the record.

## 6. Use of AI (assistive disclosure)
AI tools were used as drafting and devil’s-advocate assistance.

- Tools used: ChatGPT
- Usage scope: structuring text, checking assumptions, identifying blind spots.
- Principle: AI outputs are treated as drafts and assistance, not as truth or authority.
All final decisions remain human-made and logged as such.

## 7. Privacy & safety boundary
RTS is **not** a surveillance system.

- It does not record private life, personal thoughts, or continuous location data.
- When evidence is referenced, personal or sensitive identifiers will be minimized or redacted.
- Verifiability is prioritized without inflicting unnecessary personal harm.

## 8. Next steps
- Continue logging originator actions as `RTS-ORIGINATOR-LOG-0003.md`.
- Publish project-specific logs (e.g., RTS Miyako) as independent log streams.
- Allow third parties to inspect, critique, or fork the framework freely.
