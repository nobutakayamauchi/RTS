# RTS ORIGINATOR LOG 0009 (Recommended)

## 1. Date
2026-01-20

## 2. Actor
Nobutaka Yamauchi (Real name, RTS originator)

## 3. Purpose
This log defines a recommended (non-mandatory) convention for log naming and display titles.

The purpose is to improve readability and usability, especially for mobile users, without altering the canonical structure or validity of existing RTS logs.

## 4. Recommendation Scope
This recommendation applies to:
- Display titles
- References in documentation
- Human-facing summaries or indexes

It does **not** replace or invalidate canonical filenames.

## 5. Recommended Display Format
For human-readable contexts, the following short form is recommended:

RTS O-LOG ####

Example:
- RTS O-LOG 0009

Where:
- "O-LOG" stands for "Originator Log"
- The numeric identifier remains unchanged

## 6. Canonical Filename Preservation
The canonical filename remains authoritative:

RTS-ORIGINATOR-LOG-0009.md

Short display names are aliases only and must not be treated as separate records.

## 7. Optional Adoption
Adoption of this recommendation is voluntary.
Logs using the full canonical title remain equally valid.

No penalties, reinterpretation, or downgrade apply to non-adoption.

## 8. Status
Effective immediately as a recommendation.
