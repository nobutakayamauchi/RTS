# RTS ORIGINATOR LOG 0004

## 1. Date
2026-01-20

## 2. Actor
Nobutaka Yamauchi (Real name, RTS originator)

## 3. Context
This log records an operational clarification regarding how RTS logs are maintained in practice.

## 4. Decision
I acknowledge that I am not suited to strict daily reporting.
RTS operation prioritizes continuity and honesty over frequency or perfection.

## 5. Operational Rule
- Logs may be written irregularly.
- Delays, omissions, or retrospective entries are permitted.
- Such gaps themselves are considered part of the record, not failures.

## 6. Rationale
A system that demands perfect discipline discourages honest participation.
RTS is designed to lower the burden of truth-telling, not raise it.

## 7. Use of AI
AI assistance (ChatGPT) was used for structuring and language drafting.
All decisions and responsibility remain human.

## 8. Status
This clarification is effective immediately.
