## 2. Actor
Nobutaka Yamauchi (Real name, RTS originator)

## 3. Purpose
This log marks a structural milestone for the RTS originator logs.
It clarifies how continuation, pause, and closure are treated without implying success or failure.

## 4. Continuation
RTS originator logs continue when meaningful decisions, clarifications,
or structural changes occur.
There is no obligation to log continuously or at fixed intervals.

## 5. Pause and Silence
Periods without new logs are neutral.
Silence may indicate stability, focus on execution, or deliberate non-logging.
Silence must not be interpreted as concealment by default.

## 6. Closure
RTS does not require a formal termination log.
If this series ceases, existing logs remain valid historical artifacts.
No retroactive edits are permitted.

## 7. Scope Boundary
This log concludes the initial structuring phase of RTS originator logs.
Subsequent logs may address optimization, presentation, or operational refinements.

## 8. Status
Effective immediately.
