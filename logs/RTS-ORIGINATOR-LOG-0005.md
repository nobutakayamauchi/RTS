# RTS ORIGINATOR LOG 0005

## 1. Date
2026-01-20

## 2. Actor
Nobutaka Yamauchi (Real name)

## 3. Purpose
This log defines when an RTS Originator Log must be created.

## 4. Logging Principle
An originator log SHALL be created when any of the following occurs:
- A structural rule or interpretation of RTS is clarified or changed
- A decision materially affects trust, governance, or transparency
- Ambiguity exists and the originator chooses a path
- Silence or inaction itself may be interpreted as intent

## 5. Non-requirement
RTS does not require daily activity logs.
Absence of a log does not imply inactivity or concealment.

## 6. Anti-abuse Clause
Logs are not created retroactively to justify outcomes.
Retrospective logs may exist only to clarify process, not to alter history.

## 7. Binding Effect
These rules bind the originator more strictly than any external party.
