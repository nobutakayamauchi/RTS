Meta

Operator: nobutaka yamauchi
Framework: RTS (Real-Time Trust System)
AI Support: ChatGPT GPT-5.2
Date: 2026-02-20 JST
Mode: Reconstruction → Execution Transition
Confidence: High (Operator confirmed reconstruction)

⸻

Overview

This block consolidates approximately sixty hours of operational activity including conceptual restructuring, revenue infrastructure activation, outreach experimentation, and RTS implementation escalation.

Primary transition observed:

Concept → Execution → Monetization Preparation

⸻

D1 — RTS Productization Decision

Background:

RTS previously functioned primarily as a conceptual framework.

Risk identified:
	•	Context loss
	•	AI dependency instability
	•	Reproducibility issues

Decision:

Transition RTS into a reproducible product system.

Actions:
	•	YAML structure discussion
	•	validator concept planning
	•	index automation consideration
	•	GitHub operational dependency strengthened

Status:

ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION

⸻

D2 — Revenue Stability Model Redefinition

Operator redefined income structure.

Target:

750k JPY stability layer
+250k JPY growth buffer

Risk Awareness:
	•	Full-drive dependency burnout risk.
	•	Sensory degradation fear recognized.

Status:

UNDER STRUCTURAL REVIEW

⸻

D3 — Research OS Concept Formation

Problem:

Operator self-identified research inefficiency.

Reframing:

Research ≠ searching.

Research = Question Design.

Compression Model Proposed:

10000 → 1000 → 100 → 10 → 3

Outcome:

Research OS Prototype Concept Established.

Status:

PROTOTYPE COMPLETE

⸻

D4 — RTS Miyako Waiting Phase Decision

Timeline:

Feb 1:
Initial contact sent to Miyako City.

Feb 3:
Assistant Professor and Lecturer contacted after delayed follow-up attempt.

Observation:

No response received after approximately two weeks.

Interpretation Policy:

Neutral assumption adopted.

Possible causes:
	•	Academic workload.
	•	Inquiry buried.
	•	Decision uncertainty.
	•	Seasonal academic pressure.

Decision:
	•	No blame interpretation.
	•	One-week reminder schedule prepared.
	•	Tohoku University expansion preparation initiated.

Status:

WAITING → EXECUTION PREPARATION

⸻

D5 — Payment Infrastructure Initialization (Stripe)

Execution:

Date:
2026-02-20 approx 05:00 JST.

Condition:

Cold environment.
Physical tremor noted during execution.

Actions:
	•	Identity verification initiated.
	•	Account configuration input.
	•	Basic payment environment setup.

Current Status:

UNDER REVIEW / APPROVAL WAITING.

Observed Issue:

Payment link creation produced configuration error.

Interpretation:

Infrastructure partially operational.

Meaning:

First physical monetization infrastructure activation within RTS lifecycle.

Status:

PENDING VALIDATION

⸻

D6 — X Outreach Experiment Initiated

Objective:

Immediate revenue experimentation.

Actions:
	•	Candidate research using Grok.
	•	Direct message outreach executed.

Status:

RESPONSE WAITING.

⸻

D7 — RTS Implementation Surge (Unstructured Creation Phase)

Operator entered high-output creation phase.

Characteristics:
	•	Extensive GitHub editing.
	•	README restructuring.
	•	Log schema modification.
	•	Asset packaging experimentation.
	•	Gumroad deployment preparation.

Observation:

Some operational confusion acknowledged by operator.

Interpretation:

Creative acceleration phase rather than disorder.

Status:

ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION

⸻

Risk Awareness

Primary Risks:
	•	Context fragmentation.
	•	Over-branching workload.
	•	Revenue delay pressure.

Mitigation:

RTS logging stabilization adopted.

⸻

State Assessment

RTS:

IMPLEMENTATION PHASE.

ResearchOS:

CONCEPTUAL PROTOTYPE COMPLETE.

Revenue Infrastructure:

INITIALIZED.

Outreach:

ACTIVE.

Mental State:

High Rotation Operational Mode (Monitoring Recommended).

⸻

Summary

The last sixty hours represent systemic transition rather than exploration.

RTS moved from philosophy into executable operational infrastructure.
