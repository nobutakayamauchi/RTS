## Reason for Generation Reset

RTS logs previously existed in a separate branch.

That log set remains intact and unmodified.

However:

- Mobile-only operation made branch merging unsafe.
- Main branch lacked the full historical log chain.
- Operational clarity required a clean, inspectable starting point.

Therefore, Generation 2 begins on `main`.

This is a structural reset — not a historical rewrite.

---

## Archive Location (Generation 1)

Previous logs are preserved in:

Branch: `f1d326d`  
Directory: `/logs/`

These logs are considered immutable archive records.

They are not deleted.  
They are not rewritten.  
They are not merged retroactively.

They remain as historical reference.

## Structural Principle

From this point forward:

- Main branch is the authoritative operational chain.
- Logs are append-only.
- Confusion must be logged.
- Structural changes require explicit logging.

RTS does not erase history.  
RTS forks generations when structure demands it.

## Intent

This generation exists to:

- Prevent silent divergence.
- Maintain decision traceability.
- Reduce cognitive load.
- Avoid repeating structural decay.

"History is preserved.
Structure is reset.
Integrity continues."
