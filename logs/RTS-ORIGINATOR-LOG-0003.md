# RTS ORIGINATOR LOG 0003

## 1. Date
2026-01-20

## 2. Actor
Nobutaka Yamauchi (Real name, originator)

## 3. Action
Publicly created the RTS repository and published the initial charter (README.md) and originator log (LOG-0001).

## 4. Decision Context
This action was taken to:
- Establish a public, inspectable canonical repository
- Bind the originator’s own actions to the same logging rules imposed on others
- Demonstrate that RTS begins with self-accountability, not authority

## 5. Assumptions
- Public visibility increases scrutiny but also credibility
- Early exposure reduces later narrative manipulation
- No immediate institutional adoption is expected

## 6. Risks & Costs
- Misinterpretation or premature criticism
- Association of RTS with the originator’s personal reputation
- Zero immediate benefit or validation

## 7. Alternatives Considered
- Keeping RTS private until “completion” (rejected)
- Publishing anonymously (rejected)

## 8. Rationale
RTS cannot credibly demand transparency from others if its originator avoids early exposure.
This log records the decision to accept that asymmetry risk.

## 9. Status
Action completed. Repository is public.

## 10. Notes
Future objections, forks, or reinterpretations are expected and welcomed as part of RTS operation.
