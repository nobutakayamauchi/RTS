Decision Logging Operating System for AI Execution Continuity.

Decision Logging Operating System for AI Execution Continuity.

---

## Quick Start

Run RTS locally:


The guided starter initializes a local RTS workspace.

It creates:

- logs/
- evolution/
- vibecode/

Nothing is uploaded anywhere unless you explicitly push to GitHub.

---

## Official Public Site

https://nobutakayamauchi.github.io/RTS/

This repository and the GitHub Pages deployment function as public timestamped operational evidence.

---

## Origin

Creator: Nobutaka Yamauchi  
Initial Public Release: 2026

RTS (Real Time Trust System) is a decision-logging operating system designed to preserve reasoning continuity inside AI workflows.

RTS converts temporary AI collaboration into persistent operational memory through structured execution logging.

---

## Concept Summary

Modern AI workflows suffer from:

- conversational reset loss
- reasoning fragmentation
- execution discontinuity

RTS addresses this by treating cognition itself as infrastructure.

Execution becomes memory.

Memory becomes identity.

---

## What RTS Records

RTS captures:

- reasoning decisions
- execution context
- research paths
- operational outcomes
- iteration history
- evolution experiments

AI collaboration becomes reproducible.

---

## Operational Model

RTS operates through a continuous execution loop:

CAPTURE → EVALUATE → DECIDE → EXECUTE → AUDIT → EVOLVE → RECORD → RESET

Human operator authority remains final.

RTS observes execution.

It never replaces human judgement.

---

## Authorship & Provenance

RTS is an original framework concept created and publicly operated by the creator listed above.

Authorship continuity is established through:

- Git commit history
- GitHub Release timestamps
- GitHub Pages deployment history
- BLOCK structured execution logs
- Governance documentation

These collectively function as historical provenance evidence.

---

## Research & Academic Use

RTS may be referenced or cited as:

Real Time Trust System (RTS), Yamauchi, N. (2026).

Public repository and operational history serve as primary reference material.

---

## Integrity Protection

Removal or falsification of:

- authorship attribution
- execution logs
- provenance records

is considered repository integrity violation.

RTS logs are designed as historical execution evidence.

Forks are permitted.

Misrepresentation is not.

---

## Trademark & Naming Notice

“RTS — Real Time Trust System” is a project identity publicly associated with its original creator.

Derivative works or forks may not:

- present themselves as the official RTS project
- imply endorsement
- reuse branding identity commercially

without explicit permission from the creator.

Commercial branding usage requires separate authorization.

This protects project identity while allowing open technical collaboration.

---

## Security Philosophy

RTS assumes:

trust must be auditable.

Decisions must survive execution.

History must survive iteration.

Transparency reduces operational risk.

---

## Repository Structure

Core folders:

- logs/ → execution evidence
- evolution/ → experimentation history
- vibecode/ → agent workflow space

Governance and specification documents define operational scope.

## Status

Experimental — active public execution.

Development intentionally occurs in the open.

Execution authority belongs to the operator.

---

## Creator Statement

RTS exists to prevent loss of thinking.

Ideas should survive execution.

History should survive iteration.

Continuity creates trust.
