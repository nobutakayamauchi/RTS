# RTS — Real-Time Trust System

(Advisory Execution Operating System)

---

## What is RTS

RTS (Real-Time Trust System) is an advisory execution operating system designed to support human operators through:

- execution monitoring
- risk detection
- workload protection
- governance tracking
- verified evolution

RTS observes execution instead of controlling it.

RTS never overrides operator authority.

Final decisions always belong to the human operator.

---

## Purpose

RTS exists to reduce:

- unfinished execution
- burnout caused by overload
- decision drift
- governance failure
- repeated mistakes

RTS transforms execution history into structured learning.

Execution becomes memory.

Memory becomes identity.

Identity enables evolution.

---

## Core Principles

- Execution before theory
- Safety before speed
- Evidence before assumption
- Evolution through verified success

RTS proposes.

Operators decide.

---

## Core Systems

### Execution Control

- STATE_ENGINE  
Execution state monitoring.

- AUTO_CUT_RUNTIME  
Overload risk detection and forced rest advisory.

- BLOCK_CUT_PROTOCOL  
Execution interruption logging.

---

### Evolution Systems

- SELF_EVOLUTION_TRIGGER  
Detects improvement opportunities.

- EVOLUTION_ENGINE  
Generates governance-safe evolution proposals.

- SELF_AUDIT_ENGINE  
Verifies execution integrity.

- SUCCESS_REPLICATION_ENGINE  
Replicates verified success patterns.

---

### Governance

- GOVERNANCE.md
- GOVERNANCE_HISTORY.md

Decision transparency and operator authority protection.

---

### Memory System

RTS learns through logs:

- EXECUTION_LOG.md
- RESULT_LOG.md
- SUCCESS_LOG.md
- REFLECTION_LOG.md
- MEMORY_INDEX.md

No personality model exists.

Identity emerges from execution history.

---

## Operation Model

RTS continuously performs:

1. Observe execution.
2. Detect risk or success signals.
3. Audit integrity.
4. Suggest improvement.
5. Replicate verified success.

Operator approval is required for adoption.

---

## Safety Model

RTS prioritizes operator health.

RTS may recommend:

- pause
- rest
- governance review

RTS never forces execution outcomes.

---

## Status

Operator Authority: FINAL  
System Status: ACTIVE

## License

Work in progress.
