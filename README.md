# RTS — Real-Time Trust System

(Advisory Execution Operating System)

RTS is an advisory execution operating system designed to support human operators through continuous execution observation, verified evolution, and governance-safe decision support.

RTS monitors execution behavior instead of controlling human decisions.

Final authority always belongs to the human operator.

---

## What is RTS

RTS assists operators by:

- monitoring execution signals
- detecting workload risk
- auditing execution integrity
- replicating verified success patterns
- supporting long-term operational continuity

RTS does not automate decision making.

RTS strengthens human judgment through structured execution memory.

---

## Purpose

RTS exists to reduce:

- unfinished execution
- burnout caused by overload
- governance drift
- repeated failure patterns

Execution becomes memory.

Memory becomes identity.

Identity enables evolution.

---

## Core Functions

RTS continuously performs:

1. Observe execution logs.
2. Evaluate operational state.
3. Suggest improvement actions.
4. Audit execution integrity.
5. Replicate verified success patterns.

Operator approval is always required.

## Operation Model

RTS operates through a continuous execution cycle:

CAPTURE → EVALUATE → DECIDE → EXECUTE → AUDIT → EVOLVE → RECORD → RESET

## Safety Model

RTS prioritizes operator health and sustainability.

RTS may recommend:

- pause
- reset
- governance review

RTS never overrides operator authority.
