RTS — Real Time Trust System

Origin

Creator: Nobutaka YamauchiInitial Public Release: 2026

RTS (Real Time Trust System) is a decision-logging operating system designed to preserve reasoning continuity inside AI workflows.

RTS transforms temporary AI conversations into persistent, version-controlled operational memory.

Authorship & Provenance Notice

RTS is an original framework concept created and publicly operated by the creator listed above.

The following elements function as provenance evidence:

Git commit history

BLOCK structured execution logs

Repository timestamps

Governance documents

These records collectively establish historical authorship continuity.

Forks and derivative works must retain attribution.

Core Philosophy

Modern AI workflows suffer from:

memory loss

reasoning fragmentation

execution discontinuity

RTS treats cognition as infrastructure.

Instead of restarting from zero each session, RTS records:

reasoning decisions

execution context

research paths

operational outcomes

evolution experiments

AI thinking becomes reproducible.

Execution becomes memory.

Memory becomes identity.

Operational Model

RTS operates through a continuous execution cycle:

CAPTURE → EVALUATE → DECIDE → EXECUTE → AUDIT → EVOLVE → RECORD → RESET

Human operator authority is always final.

RTS observes execution.

It never replaces human judgement.

Integrity Protection

Removal or falsification of authorship, provenance records, or execution history is considered a violation of repository integrity.

RTS logs are designed as historical execution evidence.

Forks are permitted.

Misrepresentation is not.

Status

Experimental — actively evolving in public execution.

RTS development history is intentionally transparent.

Execution authority belongs to the operator.

Creator Statement

RTS exists to prevent loss of thinking.

Ideas should survive execution.

History should survive iteration.

Continuity creates trust.
