# Real-Time Trust System (RTS)

Real-Time Trust System (RTS) is a framework for **recording decisions, not enforcing conclusions**.

RTS does not define what is right.
RTS does not decide outcomes.
RTS exists to preserve **how decisions were made**, under what assumptions, with what information, and at what cost.

---

## Purpose

RTS was created to:
- Record **Do / No-Do decisions** under a common, inspectable structure
- Preserve assumptions, constraints, and uncertainties at the time of decision
- Enable third-party verification *after the fact*
- Prevent the rewriting of history through selective memory

RTS is a tool for accountability, not control.

---

## What RTS Does / Does Not Do

### RTS DOES:
- Record decisions in time sequence
- Preserve assumptions, estimates, and known risks
- Record costs, impacts, and uncertainties
- Accept criticism, counter-evidence, and later correction as logs

### RTS DOES NOT:
- Score morality or correctness
- Enforce judgments or penalties
- Optimize outcomes through numerical weighting
- Track private lives, thoughts, or personal location data

## Core Log Categories

RTS operates through structured logs:

1. **Decision Log**  
   Who decided what, when, and based on which information.

2. **Cost & Financial Log**  
   Initial cost, operational cost, future liabilities — estimates and actuals.

3. **Impact & Safety Log**  
   Environmental, social, safety, and risk impacts.

4. **Information Environment Log**  
   Sources used for decisions and their credibility at the time.

## Handling of Numbers

- Early-stage figures must be expressed as **ranges**, not fixed values.
- Each number is tagged with confidence level: Low / Medium / High.
- Later corrections do not erase past values; differences are appended.
- Once recorded, values are never overwritten.

---

## Participation, Review, and Approval

- Anyone may observe and verify logs.
- Approval requires **at least two real-name signatories**.
- Approvers rotate to prevent concentration of authority.
- Even after approval, objections and audits may be logged.

---

## Governance

RTS has a single originator who publishes the initial charter.
However, the originator **does not possess exclusive authority** over approval, operation, or judgment.

RTS is designed to survive its creator.

## Freeze Clause

This document is frozen as version 1.0.

No modification, deletion, or revision of this text shall occur.
Interpretation and operational guidance may be added through
supplementary documents and live logs, which do not alter this charter.

---

## Positioning

RTS does not support any ideology or predetermined conclusion.

Through real-world application, RTS aims to establish a
transparent, verifiable model of decision-making
that can be examined long after decisions are made.

*RTS records how humans chose —  
and lets the world decide what that choice meant.*
