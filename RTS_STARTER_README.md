# RTS Starter Kit

Real-Time Trust System (RTS)

A framework for recording decisions, not enforcing conclusions.

---

## What This Is

RTS is a decision logging and governance system that:

- records decisions immutably
- logs execution cycles automatically
- enforces approval-based structural evolution
- creates verifiable audit trails

RTS does NOT enforce behavior.

RTS records behavior.

## Requirements

- GitHub account
- GitHub repository
- No server required

---

## Installation (5 minutes)

Step 1:
Upload all files into your repository.

Step 2:
Ensure `.github/workflows/run.yml` exists.

Step 3:
Go to:

Actions → RTS Vibecode Runner → Run workflow

RTS will activate.

---

## Verification

Open:

logs/EXECUTION_LOG.md

You should see:

RTS execution cycle started
RTS execution cycle completed

---

## Governance

Only the originator may approve structural changes.

RTS cannot modify itself without approval.

## Status

## Why RTS Exists (10000-Chunk Problem)

When AI-generated systems grow, hidden structural drift accumulates.

You start with 100 chunks.
Then 1,000.
Then 10,000.

At scale, manual full inspection becomes impossible.
Small deviations compound.
Intent silently diverges.

RTS is not built to generate output.
RTS is built to prevent structural decay.

RTS helps you:

- Stop full inspection collapse
- Reduce initial defect rate through structured logging
- Identify failure clusters instead of reviewing everything
- Preserve decision context before drift becomes irreversible

RTS is a system for reducing cognitive load,
not increasing automation.

It prevents silent divergence before it becomes 10,000 broken chunks.

RTS is ACTIVE.

Integrity: VERIFIED.
