# RTS Starter Kit

Real-Time Trust System (RTS)

A framework for recording decisions, not enforcing conclusions.

---

## What This Is

RTS is a decision logging and governance system that:

- records decisions immutably
- logs execution cycles automatically
- enforces approval-based structural evolution
- creates verifiable audit trails

RTS does NOT enforce behavior.

RTS records behavior.
