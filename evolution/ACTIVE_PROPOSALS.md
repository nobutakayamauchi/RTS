## PROPOSAL_0001
### TITLE
AUTO-CUT RUNTIME IMPLEMENTATION

### STATUS
APPROVED

Approved by: Nobutaka Yamauchi
Approval reason: AUTO-CUT runtime required for operator workload safety and RTS execution continuity.

### GENERATED BY
RTS EVOLUTION ENGINE


### DATE
2026-02-20 (JST)

---

### CONTEXT

Repeated high workload execution cycles detected.

Manual BLOCK logging dependency observed.
Operator workload intensity increasing.

AUTO-CUT GOVERNOR rule exists but runtime trigger automation not yet implemented.

---

### PROPOSAL

Implement minimal AUTO-CUT runtime assistant.

System should:

- Monitor conversation turns
- Track execution time estimation
- Detect external execution events
- Prompt operator when BLOCK logging recommended.

User response options:

CUT → Generate BLOCK draft.

SKIP → Continue session.

LATER(30) → Postpone reminder.

---

### EXPECTED EFFECT

Prevent overwork.
Reduce missed BLOCK logging.
Improve audit continuity.
Maintain operator cognitive stability.

---

### SAFETY

RTS must recommend pause when workload risk detected.

Human operator retains final decision authority.
