# RTS INCIDENT REPORT

Incident ID: INC_20260222_1704

Severity: S2

System: GPT / Research Interaction

Status: OPEN

---

## Symptom

AI researcher publicly reports reasoning instability and early prompt failures across frontier LLM models.

Observed degradation includes proper noun failures and early reasoning collapse.

---

## Root Cause

Long-context reasoning instability and persistent memory degradation during extended workflows.

---

## Operational Impact

Operators must manually validate outputs earlier and more frequently.

Reduced reliability for research workflows and GPT creator operations.

---

## RTS Intervention

Operator initiated structured execution logging and research dialogue engagement to validate operational memory hypothesis.

---

## Lessons Learned

LLM reasoning degradation is now observable even within shorter token windows.

Persistent operational logging becomes critical for continuity.
