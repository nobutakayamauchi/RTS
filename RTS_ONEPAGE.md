# RTS — Real-Time Trust System

(Advisory Execution Operating System)

---

## Who RTS Is For

RTS is designed for operators working with AI continuously.

Examples:

- AI researchers running long experiments.
- AI marketers testing prompts and funnels.
- Startup founders making strategic AI-assisted decisions.
- Independent builders collaborating daily with AI agents.

RTS prevents loss of reasoning across sessions.

Execution history becomes operational memory.

## WHAT IS RTS

RTS is an advisory execution operating system designed to support human operators through continuous execution observation and verified evolution.

RTS monitors execution instead of controlling behavior.

Final decisions always belong to the human operator.

---

## PURPOSE

RTS exists to reduce:

- unfinished execution
- burnout caused by overload
- governance drift
- repeated decision failure

Execution becomes memory.

Memory becomes identity.

Identity enables evolution.

---

## CORE FUNCTION

RTS continuously performs:

1. Observe execution logs.
2. Detect workload and risk signals.
3. Suggest improvement actions.
4. Audit execution integrity.
5. Replicate verified success patterns.

Operator approval is required for adoption.

## CORE SYSTEMS

Execution Control:

- STATE_ENGINE
- AUTO_CUT_RUNTIME
- BLOCK_CUT_PROTOCOL

Evolution:

- SELF_EVOLUTION_TRIGGER
- EVOLUTION_ENGINE
- SELF_AUDIT_ENGINE
- SUCCESS_REPLICATION_ENGINE

Governance:

- GOVERNANCE
- GOVERNANCE_HISTORY

Memory:

- EXECUTION_LOG
- RESULT_LOG
- SUCCESS_LOG
- REFLECTION_LOG
- MEMORY_INDEX

---

## OPERATION LOOP

RTS operates through a continuous execution cycle:

CAPTURE → EVALUATE → DECIDE → EXECUTE → AUDIT → EVOLVE → RECORD → RESET

---

## SAFETY MODEL

RTS prioritizes operator health.

RTS may recommend:

- pause
- reset
- governance review

RTS never overrides operator authority.

---

## POSITIONING

RTS is not automation.

RTS is not artificial decision replacement.

RTS is an advisory execution OS designed to preserve human authority while improving execution outcomes.

---

---

## USE CASES

RTS is actively used for:

- Long-term AI research execution logging.
- Prompt engineering experimentation tracking.
- Startup strategic decision journaling.
- AI-assisted product development history recording.
- Burnout prevention through execution visibility.

RTS converts temporary AI interaction into operational continuity.

---

## WHY RTS EXISTS

Modern AI workflows restart thinking every session.

Ideas disappear.
Decisions fragment.
Execution history is lost.

RTS exists to preserve continuity.

Execution becomes memory.
Memory becomes identity.
Identity enables evolution.
