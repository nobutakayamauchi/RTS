# Real-Time Trust System (RTS)

RTS is a framework for recording and reviewing decisions,
especially in situations where “not deciding” also carries cost.

This page provides a minimal overview of the RTS philosophy.

## What RTS is
- Records decisions and non-decisions
- Preserves context and constraints
- Allows third-party review
- Prevents responsibility inflation

## Current Status
RTS is in early operational use.
Action logs are being recorded publicly.
