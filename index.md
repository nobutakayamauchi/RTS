# RTS — Real Time Trust System

(Advisory Execution Operating System)

---

## Execution becomes memory.

## Memory becomes identity.

RTS is an advisory execution operating system designed to preserve reasoning continuity inside AI workflows.

It records decisions, execution context, and operational history so thinking survives beyond individual sessions.

---

## Built for AI Operators

RTS is designed for operators working continuously with AI.

Designed for:
- AI researchers
- GPT workflow builders
- startup operators
- prompt engineers

RTS prevents loss of reasoning across sessions.  
Execution history becomes operational memory.

---

## Why RTS?

Modern AI workflows restart thinking every session.

Ideas disappear.  
Execution history is lost.

RTS turns execution into operational memory.
